        <p> 
            Hi! I'm Connor Foster. I'm a one man operation dedicated to creating delicious breads, pastries, and cakes. <br>
            I have always had a passion for baking. After graduating college, I got my first "professional" gig decorating cakes at HyVee in Marion, Iowa.<br>
            Though I since moved to Chicago in the summer of 2023 to pursue my current career as a Software Engineer, I started the process of creating this business in 2025 as a labor of love.<br>
            I make all my products from sratch using as high quality ingredients as are readily available to me (thank you Costco for carrying 12 lb bags of King Arthur Flour). I love working with seasonal produce and experimenting with new flavors and developing new recipes.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>About the Kitchen</h2>
        <p>
            I operate as a Cottage Food Operation in the state of Illinois. This means that all my products are made in a home kitchen that is not inspected by a health department. <br>
            I take food safety very seriously and follow all guidelines for safe food handling and production, and am Serv Safe certified as a food safety manager. If you have any concerns about food safety, please contact your local health department for more information.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>About the Pricing</h2>
        <p>
            I strive to make all my prices fair and equitable for both myself and my customers. I am frequently scolded by friends for asking them what they think a fair price is, rather than just charging them a number. <br>
            I want to keep my prices low enough to offer a fair level of entry for people who want to try my products, but high enough cover cost of ingredients and compensate me for my time, as well as my skills and how intricate the product is.<br>
            Here's a breakdown of my price calculation:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost of Ingredients - For example, a two dozen cage-free eggs is $4.59 at Costco, so 6 eggs costs $1.15</li>
                <li>Labor - I charge the minimum wage of Chicago, which is $16.60/hr</li>
                <li>Packaging Costs</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
